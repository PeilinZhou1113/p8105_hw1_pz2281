# Problem 1

``` r
set.seed(2)

sample_df = 
  tibble(
    normal_sample = rnorm(10),
    greater_than_0 = as.logical(normal_sample > 0),
    char_vec = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
    factor_vec = factor(c("cold","hot","worm","hot","worm","hot","worm","cold","cold","hot"))
  )

avg_normal=mean(pull(sample_df, normal_sample))

avg_greater = mean(pull(sample_df, greater_than_0))

avg_char = mean(pull(sample_df, char_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(sample_df, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
avg_factor = mean(pull(sample_df, factor_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(sample_df, factor_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

Average values of the normal distribution sample vector and the logical
vector were successfully calculated. However, warning massages displayed
for calculating the average of charactor vector and factor vector. Both
of them returned NA as the average.

``` r
num_logical = as.numeric(pull(sample_df, greater_than_0))

num_char = as.numeric(pull(sample_df, char_vec))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
num_fac = as.numeric(pull(sample_df, factor_vec))
```

Logical vector has been converted into numeric format of ones and zeros
and factor vector has been converted to numeric vector where each number
represents a different category/level. However, the charactor vector was
unable to be converted to a numeric vector. A warning message was
displayed: NAs introduced by coercion. This explained why we were unable
to calculate the average of this vector, since the elements in the
charactor vector are not string representations of numbers, they cannot
be understood and transformed into logical or numeric vectors which R
can process their average values.
